# Raw Dataset

 We recruit 24 children aged 5 - 6 years randomly selected from the preschools in Beijing to participate in the study. Each child performed 8 activities (0:'run', 1: 'tidy toys', 2:'walk slow', 3:'jump jack', 4:'hopscotch', 5:'walk fast', 6:'watch video’, 7:'listen story'.) wearing Cosmed mask, ActiGraph device and our device modified from Hexiwear device. The dataset includes the following 4 parts: 

* 'marks.xlsx': Links the subjects' activities with their performance time and date.

* 'cosmed.d': Datasets collected by Cosmed K4b2. Each file identifies the subject who performed one of two parts tasks. Each task may including different types of activities.

* 'actigraph.d': Datasets collected by ActiGraph device.
	*	'raw.d': Each subject file includes 3-axial inertial signals measured from the 1st accelerometer in the device.
	*	'cnt.d': Each subject file includes count values calculated from the 1st accelerometer by ActiGraph application.
	*	'IMU.d': Each subject file includes 3-axial inertial signals measured from the 2nd accelerometer, the gyroscope and the magnetometer.

* 'hexiwear.d': Datasets collected by our devices modified from Hexiwear device. Each subject file includes 3-axial inertial signals measured from the accelerometer, the gyroscope and the magnetometer.
